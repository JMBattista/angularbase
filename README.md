# angularbase
Baseline AngularJS application based on John Papa's HotTowel example.
https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel

This is not a generator, but rather a modified result of the above generator.

This can be used to bootstrap up an angular project, similar to if you used the generator directly. 

I also use it as the location where I post updates to my gulp workflow over time, so it is in a centralized location I can update and pull from.

Enjoy!
