# Angular Base
Baseline AngularJS application based on John Papa's HotTowel example.
https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel

This is a modified version of the output from generator-hottowel aimed at enabling easy bootstrapping of an Angular Project. 

## Versions
This repository is for Angular 1.x bootstraping, once Angular 2 reaches Beta I'll create a parallel project.

I have chosen to implement the rather small server side example in Koa to minimize the number of languages involved, and because the project already uses nodejs for the build system. This can easily be swapped out for other server technologies, so enjoy!

All other dependencies will be updated when it makes sense to do so to keep this starting point as relevant as possible.

## Getting Started
Download a zip of the code and place it into your repository.

Update the description files:
* bower.json
* package.json
* README.md 

Make sure you have nodejs installed 

Run the setup script via npm

```shell
npm run-script setup
```

Start the app!
```shell
gulp serve-dev
```

Now you're ready to rock and roll! See the workflow section to see more about how to leverage the gulp workflow.

## Gulp Workflow
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is an amazing tool for authoring build systems by chaining large numbers of plugins together.

The core commands of the gulp workflow used in this project are: clean, build, test, autotest, watch and serve-dev. These commands can be triggered from the command line directly or from a number of editors/IDEs that feature gulp integration. If you want to know how to integrate gulp with your editor/IDE of choice please check their documentation.

#### Clean/Build/Test 
These are your standard build system commands, and aren't terribly exciting.

To remove all files generated by the build process
    gulp clean

To run the build process
    gulp build
    
To run Tests and Style validation
    gulp test

#### Autotest
Now we're getting into more exciting territory curtesy of the *watch* concept. Watches monitor a set of files and can be used to trigger a command when the files are changed.

To start the autotest process
    gulp autotest
    
This will automatically run the test command described above any time you modify a file in your code base. I like to turn this on and keep it up on a second monitor.

#### Watch
If testing your code changes automatically was interesting what about automatically pushing them to the website automatically? That's what the watch command does in conjunction with a chrome extension called [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

To kick this off run
    gulp watch
Now every time a file is modified the build process will be re-run to update the .dist folder with the new version, and LiveReload will automatically push it to your browser. Updates to CSS files are pushed without reloading the page allowing for an amazing development experience as you tweak the settings to get them just right. Javascript and HTML changes force the browser to reload the page, but for any reasonable site this will be a very fast operation.

As you might expect running the *entire* build process for every file edit would be costly, see the **Speed** sub section for more information.

#### Serve Dev
This builds on what is a common theme for gulp, the power of the watch. Using gulp to start the web server, in this example koa, and then restarting it whenever changes are made to it. 

    gulp serve-dev
    
The result of using *autotest* and *serve-dev* together is a fast and fluid workflow process where changes made by the developer are immediately vetted by tests and pushed to their local test instance without any more thought than pressing save. This allows the build tool to get out of the developers way and speed up the process dramatically.


Enjoy!
